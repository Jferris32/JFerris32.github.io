        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology Under-GraduateðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Starting post-secondary education in the year 2018, my educational journey started at University California, Riverside. Attending for two years before the global pandemic hit, I decided to break from college courses and work at my fatherâ€™s Custom Automotive shop, Rezurxn Speed and Marine. I worked the front desk at Rezurxn for the entirety of the pandemic, working in front of customers, managing sales, managing inventory, and managing paperwork of those sales and inventory. All shipping and receivables came through me at the front desk, as well as pick-up and delivery of parts, paperwork and small customerâ€™s projects in addition to the aforementioned front desk management. There isnâ€™t anywhere in California I have not driven and delivered material and parts too: from Las Vegas, Nevada to San Diego, I have been there. During this time I also semi-managed and fostered established relationships with local businesses in the High Desert area. My management of the front desk included managing all paperwork for receivables and front desk sales. While there were wrenches turning in the back of the shop, I sorted and cataloged all small transactions whether they were my sale or another member of shop employment. All retail paperwork and holdings were my responsibility, which means that all paperwork outside of custom projects from business years 2020 to 2024 were documented and stored under my care, and paperwork associated with custom projects I helped organize and store<br><br>

        During the Summer of 2023, I accepted a humble position as a weekend facilities custodian at my local church, High Desert Church. This consisted of creating a safe, clean and comfortable environment for the individuals and their families attending at the Apple Valley campus, an auxiliary campus to the main Victorville campus. Within a year, I was promoted based on my leadership, organizational skills and prior experience with delivery driving to not only supervise all members within the custodial and facilities team; but to also work parallel with the tech team to assist in delivery from the Victorville campus, set-up and tear down of all High Desert Church tech equipment at the Apple Valley campus. Currently I manage and supervise a team of seven, while also driving and delivering tech equipment. During church service, I am also expected to visit and assist all campuses in clean-up and general deliveries between campuses as it is seen fit by my Events Coordinator and direct Maintenance/Facilities Manager.<br><br>

        Currently I continue my educational journey after extended Hiatus: eager to learn, grow and experience the vast world and knowledge UCR has to offer. I am currently studying under the under-graduate psychology department for the current goal of assisting and opening a personal therapeutic practice of my own specializing in clinical psychiatry. My prior experience in management as well as facilities has helped create an individual humbly dedicated to serving others, whether through moving chairs and cleaning spills, to analyzing individuals and helping process through their psychological needs. I am excited to start and learn in all my new journeys, and I cannot wait to endeavor into the next stage of my life.
